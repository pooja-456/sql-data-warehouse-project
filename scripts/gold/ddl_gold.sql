DDL Script: Create Gold Layer Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:

    This script creates dimension and fact views in the Gold layer
    of the data warehouse.

    It builds customer and product dimension views and a sales
    fact view by combining and referencing data from the Silver
    layer.

    These views represent the final, analytics-ready schema
    designed for reporting and analysis.
