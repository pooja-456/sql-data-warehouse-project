## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources:** Sales data imported from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided in CSV format.
- **Data Quality:** Data cleansing and validation are performed to resolve missing, inconsistent, and duplicate records.
- **Integration:** Data from both sources is integrated into a single, user-friendly analytical data model.
- **Scope:** The warehouse contains only the latest available data; historical tracking and slowly changing dimensions are out of scope.
